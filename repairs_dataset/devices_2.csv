Misc,,"The compressor had stopped pumping and started making loud rattling noises. This was guessed to be a broken nylon gear, but on dis-assembly the fault was even more impressive - the gears were metal, but a cast-metal flange holding one of them in place as it drove a piston, had fractured all the way across and this arm snapped off. On closer inspection it appeared that there was a small ~1mm diameter bubble in the casting on the line of this fracture, which probably initiated it due to fatigue from the cyclic stress.","End of life",No,"TTF Café Collective","Forres Restarters",2018-12-01
"Small kitchen item",Breville,"Did not start when dial was turned. We took the device completely apart in order to access the control circuit board, in a long and gruelling process that involved releasing not only screws, but also c-clips and opposite-threaded nuts on the drive shaft, which free-wheeled if torque was put on it without gripping it by the belt gear. There was lots of grease. It was nasty. At the end, the fault was found to be a blown internal glass fuse, a cheap component but one that we did not have a replacement for to hand. The user was shown how to de-solder the fuse, and may come back later for help to re-assemble this device, if not already too frustrated with its horrible anti-repair design.",Repairable,No,"TTF Café Collective","Forres Restarters",2018-12-01
"Power tool",Festool,"Plunge saw. The circular saw worked sometimes, but cut out intermittently.

We opened up the casing as far as we could, which was just all but a section immediately around the motor, then brushed, scraped & vacuumed out the visible old sawdust deposits.

So the radio was showing Unavailable and this was wrongly interpreted as the radio malfunctioning rather than the DAB signal being unavailable. We did manage to listen to a few DAB stations.

When switching on the record player, placing a record on the turntable, and switching it down to 'Start' or 'Auto' mode, the pickup (reading) arm was supposed to automatically swing into position and the disc to begin spinning, but this did not happen.

With all of the system consisting of just one motor and a highly complex assembly of mechanical/clockwork/transmission parts, we could not identify the fault after an hour, with no online help available for this decades-old piece of tech, and suspected that finding the faulty component would require spending all day dismantling and studying the mechanism.","End of life",No,"TTF Café Collective","Forres Restarters",2018-08-04
