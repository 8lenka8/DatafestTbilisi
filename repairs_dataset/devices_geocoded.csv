3330,Portable radio,Hitachi,DAB not working. Another restarter had attempted to open the radio but had been flummoxed by a screw for which they didn't have the right driver. I tried it with the owner and found it was working including on DAB. The issue was that the DAB reception was very poor where were and I suspect in the owners flat (many tall concrete building likely blocking signals and creating lots of signal reflections and crosspaths). So the radio was showing Unavailable and this was wrongly interpreted as the radio malfunctioning rather than the DAB signal being unavailable. We did manage to listen to a few DAB stations. I also suspect that reception may be better/worse depending on the multiplex on which a station belongs to.,Fixed,Brixton: Angell Delight Community Centre,Brixton Remakery,2018-08-16,"[51.47050970000001, -0.1033583]"

When switching on the record player, placing a record on the turntable, and switching it down to 'Start' or 'Auto' mode, the pickup (reading) arm was supposed to automatically swing into position and the disc to begin spinning, but this did not happen. Opening up the case, we found that the motor was spinning freely when the switch was in the 'Stop' position, but then appeared to slowly and unevenly judder around in steps when the other switch positions applied a clutch to the motor. With all of the system consisting of just one motor and a highly complex assembly of mechanical/clockwork/transmission parts, we could not identify the fault after an hour, with no online help available for this decades-old piece of tech, and suspected that finding the faulty component would require spending all day dismantling and studying the mechanism.",End of life,TTF Café Collective,Forres Restarters,2018-08-04,"[57.60979099999999, -3.61998]"
